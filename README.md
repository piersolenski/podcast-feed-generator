# Podcast Feed Generator

A super simple script that generates a feed from files on your server.

Simply upload the script, add your files to the `audio` directory, and then visit the url from your podcatcher of choice.

## Settings

```php
$folder = "audio";
$thumbnail = "www.my-awesome-thumbnail.com"
```
